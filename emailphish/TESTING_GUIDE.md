# PhishMail Guard - New Alert UI Testing Guide

## Overview
We've implemented a modern, dynamic phishing alert UI system that shows color-coded alerts based on phishing risk percentage. The system now includes four distinct alert levels with detailed popup overlays.

## New Features Added

### 🎨 **Four Color-Coded Alert Levels**
- **High Danger (80%+)**: Red alert with exclamation icon and "Phishing – High Danger"
- **Possible Phishing (60-79%)**: Yellow warning with triangle icon and "Possible Phishing – Be Aware"
- **Few Red Flags (5-59%)**: Orange caution with circle icon and "Few Red Flags – Be Aware"
- **Safe (<5%)**: Green safe with checkmark and "Safe – Very Low Risk of Phishing"

### 📊 **Enhanced Alert Cards**
- Modern card design with gradients and shadows
- Color-coded left borders for instant recognition
- Phishing risk percentage display
- Expandable details button

### 🔍 **Detailed Analysis Popup**
- Progress bars showing phishing vs safety scores
- Bullet-pointed reasons for classification
- Action buttons: Ignore, Report, Block
- Professional recommendations based on risk level

### 🎭 **Clean Email View**
- **NO visual elements are added to email content**
- Analysis results stored invisibly as data attributes
- All UI appears only as popup notifications
- Email viewing experience remains completely clean
